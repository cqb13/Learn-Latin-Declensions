# The Five Declensions

- Latin nouns are classified into **five** declension categories
  - Distinguished by the final letter of the stem and the termination of the genitive singular
- Declensions are essential for correctly inflecting nouns
- A set of declensions is made of the **six** cases
  - Nominative
  - Genitive
  - Dative
  - Accusative
  - Vocative
  - Ablative
- **Note:** Latin has no definite article (the) or indefinite article (a, an)

  - The meaning of a noun is determined by its ending and its context

    Ex:

    ```
    Porta
    The gate / A gate
    ```
