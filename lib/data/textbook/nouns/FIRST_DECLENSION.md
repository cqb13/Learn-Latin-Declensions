# First Declension

## ā-Stems

Latin nouns of the First Declension typically end, in the Nominative Singular, in "-ă" (weakened from "-ā") and belong to the Feminine gender. They are declined as follows, using the example "porta" (gate) with the stem "portā-":

### Singular

| Cases | Meanings | Terminations |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | porta    | -ă           |
| Gen.  | portae   | -ae          |
| Dat.  | portae   | -ae          |
| Acc.  | portam   | -am          |
| Voc.  | porta    | -ă           |
| Abl.  | portā    | -ā           |

### Plural

| Cases | Meanings | Terminations |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | portae   | -ae          |
| Gen.  | portārum | -ārum        |
| Dat.  | portīs   | -īs          |
| Acc.  | portās   | -ās          |
| Voc.  | portae   | -ae          |
| Abl.  | portīs   | -īs          |

1. In Latin, there is no definite article, so "porta" can mean either "a gate" or "the gate." Similarly, in the plural, it can mean "gates" or "the gates."

## Peculiarities of Nouns of the First Declension

1. Exceptions in Gender: Some nouns denoting males are masculine, such as "nauta" (sailor) and "agricola" (farmer). Additionally, "Hadria" (Adriatic Sea) is also masculine.

2. Rare Case-Endings:
   - An old form of the Genitive Singular in "-ās" is preserved in the combination "pater familiās" (father of a family) and "māter familiās" (mother of a family). However, the regular form of the Genitive in "-ae" is also acceptable.
   - In poetry, a Genitive in "-āī" may occur
   - The Locative Singular ends in "-ae," such as "Rōmae" (at Rome).
   - A Genitive Plural in "-um" instead of "-ārum" sometimes occurs, representing a distinct case-ending.
   - Instead of the regular ending "-īs," the Dative and Ablative Plural of "dea" (goddess) and "fīlia" (daughter) may have "-ābus" to distinguish them from the corresponding forms of "deus" (god) and "fīlius" (son). Some other words may also exhibit this peculiarity.

## Greek Nouns

Greek nouns, in the Singular, end in "-ē" (Feminine) or "-ās" and "-ēs" (Masculine). In the Plural, they are declined like regular Latin nouns of the First Declension. In the Singular, they are declined as follows, using the examples "Archiās" and "Epitomē" (Epitome):

Archiās, Archias; Epitomē, epitome; Comētēs, comet.

| Cases | Archiās          | Epitomē  | Comētēs        |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Nom.  | Archiās          | epitomē  | comētēs        |
| Gen.  | Archiae          | epitomēs | comētae        |
| Dat.  | Archiae          | epitomae | comētae        |
| Acc.  | Archiam (or -ān) | epitomēn | comētēn        |
| Voc.  | Archiā           | epitomē  | comētē (or -ă) |
| Abl.  | Archiā           | epitomē  | comētē (or -ā) |

1. However, most Greek nouns ending in "-ē" become regular Latin nouns in "-a" and are declined like "porta," such as "grammatica" (grammar), "mūsica" (music), and "rhētorica" (rhetoric).

2. Some other peculiarities may occur, particularly in poetry.
