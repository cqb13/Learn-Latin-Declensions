# Second Declension

## ŏ-Stems

1. Pure Latin nouns of the Second Declension end in "-us," "-er," "-ir" (Masculine), and "-um" (Neuter). Originally, the Nominative Masculine ended in "-os," and the Neuter Nominative and Accusative ended in "-om."

Nouns in "-us" and "-um" are declined as follows:

**Hortus**, garden; stem, hortŏ-. **Bellum**, war; stem, bellŏ-.

### Singular

| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | hortus   | -us          |
| Gen.  | hortī    | -ī           |
| Dat.  | hortō    | -ō           |
| Acc.  | hortum   | -um          |
| Voc.  | horte    | -e           |
| Abl.  | hortō    | -ō           |

### Plural

| Cases | Meanings | Terminations |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | hortī    | -ī           |
| Gen.  | hortōrum | -ōrum        |
| Dat.  | hortīs   | -īs          |
| Acc.  | hortōs   | -ōs          |
| Voc.  | hortī    | -ī           |
| Abl.  | hortīs   | -īs          |

Nouns in "-er" and "-ir" are declined as follows:

**Puer**, boy; stem, puerŏ-. **Ager**, field; stem, agrŏ-. **Vir**, man; stem, virŏ-.

### Singular

| Cases | Meanings | Terminations |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | puer     | -            |
| Gen.  | puerī    | -ī           |
| Dat.  | puerō    | -ō           |
| Acc.  | puerum   | -um          |
| Voc.  | puer     | -            |
| Abl.  | puerō    | -ō           |

### Plural

| Cases | Meanings | Terminations |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | puerī    | -ī           |
| Gen.  | puerōrum | -ōrum        |
| Dat.  | puerīs   | -īs          |
| Acc.  | puerōs   | -ōs          |
| Voc.  | puerī    | -ī           |
| Abl.  | puerīs   | -īs          |

1. Note that in words like "puer" and "vir," the final vowel of the stem disappears in the Nominative and Vocative Singular. In "ager," the stem is further modified by the development of "e" before "r" in the Nominative and Vocative Singular.

2. Certain nouns such as "adulter" (adulterer), "gener" (son-in-law), "Līber" (Bacchus), "socer" (father-in-law), "vesper" (evening), and compounds in "-fer" and "-ger" like "signifer" (standard-bearer), "armiger" (squire) are

declined like "puer."

## Nouns in "-vus," "-vum," "-quus"

1. Nouns ending in the Nominative Singular in "-vus," "-vum," "-quus" exhibit two types of inflection in Classical Latin: an earlier and a later form.

**Earlier Inflection (including Caesar and Cicero)**

**Servos**, m., slave. **Aevom**, n., age. **Equos**, m., horse.

### Singular (Earlier Inflection)

| Cases | Meanings | Terminations |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | servos   | -os          |
| Gen.  | servī    | -ī           |
| Dat.  | servō    | -ō           |
| Acc.  | servom   | -om          |
| Voc.  | serve    | -e           |
| Abl.  | servō    | -ō           |

**Later inflection (after Cicero)**

### Singular (Later Inflection)

| Cases | Meanings | Terminations |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | servus   | -us          |
| Gen.  | servī    | -ī           |
| Dat.  | servō    | -ō           |
| Acc.  | servum   | -um          |
| Voc.  | serve    | -e           |
| Abl.  | servō    | -ō           |

1. The plural of these nouns is regular and always uniform.

## Peculiarities of Inflection in the Second Declension

1. Proper names in "-ius" regularly form the Genitive Singular in "-ī" (instead of "-iī"), and the Vocative Singular in "-ī" (instead of "-ie"). For example, "Vergīlī" (of Virgil) or "O Vergil" (instead of "Vergiliī" or "Vergilie"). In such words, the accent stands on the penult, even if it is short. Nouns in "-ajus," "-ejus" form the Genitive in "-aī," "-eī," as "Pompejus" (of Pompey), "Pompeī" (O Pompey).

2. Nouns in "-ius" and "-ium" regularly formed the Genitive Singular in "-i" (instead of "-iī") until after the beginning of the reign of Augustus (31 B.C.).
   - Nom. ingenium, fīlius
   - Gen. ingénī, fīlī

These Genitives accent the penult, even when it is short.

3. "Fīlius" forms the Vocative Singular in "-ī" (for "-ie"), viz. "fīlī" (O son!).

4. "Deus" (god) lacks the Vocative Singular. The plural is inflected as follows:

**Deus**, god

### Plural

| Cases | Meanings | Terminations |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | dī       | -            |
| Gen.  | deōrum   | -um          |
| Dat.  | dīs      | -īs          |
| Acc.  | deōs     | -os          |
| Voc.  | dī       | -            |
| Abl.  | dīs      | -īs          |

5. The Locative Singular ends in "-ī," e.g., "Corinthī" (at Corinth).

6. The Genitive Plural has

"-um" instead of "-ōrum":

- In words denoting money and measure; e.g., "talentum" (of talents), "modium" (of pecks), "sēstertium" (of sesterces).
- In "duumvir," "triumvir," "decemvir"; e.g., "duumvirum."
- Sometimes in other words; e.g., "līberum" (of the children), "socium" (of the allies).

## Exceptions to Gender in the Second Declension

1. The following nouns in "-us" are Feminine by exception:

- Names of towns, islands, trees, also some names of countries; e.g., "Aegyptus" (Egypt).
- Five special words:
  - "alvus," belly
  - "carbasus," flax
  - "colus," distaff
  - "humus," ground
  - "vannus," winnowing-fan
- A few Greek Feminines; e.g.,
  - "atomus," atom
  - "diphthongus," diphthong

2. The following nouns in "-us" are Neuter:

- "pelagus," sea
- "vīrus," poison
- "vulgus," crowd

## Greek Nouns of the Second Declension

1. Greek nouns of the Second Declension end in "-os," "-ōs" (Masculine or Feminine) and "-on" (Neuter). They are mainly proper names and are declined as follows:

**Barbitos**, m. and f., lyre. **Androgeōs**, m., Androgeos. **Īlion**, n., Troy.

### Singular

| Cases | Meanings | Terminations |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Nom.  | barbitos | -os          |
| Gen.  | barbitī  | -ī           |
| Dat.  | barbitō  | -ō           |
| Acc.  | barbiton | -on          |
| Voc.  | barbite  | -e           |
| Abl.  | barbitō  | -ō           |

1. Nouns in "-os" sometimes form the Accusative Singular in "-um" instead of "-on," e.g., "Dēlum" (Delos).

2. The plural of Greek nouns, when it occurs, is usually regular.

3. For other rare forms of Greek nouns, the lexicon may be consulted.
