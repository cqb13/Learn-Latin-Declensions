## Nouns used in the Singular only

1. Many nouns, from the nature of their signification, are regularly used in the Singular only. Thus:
   - Proper names; as, Cicerō, Cicero; Italia, Italy.
   - Nouns denoting material; as, aes, copper; lac, milk.
   - Abstract nouns; as, ignōrantia, ignorance; bonitās, goodness.
   - But the above classes of words are sometimes used in the Plural.
     - Proper names,—to denote different members of a family, or specimens of a type; as, Cicerōnēs, the Ciceros; Catōnēs, men like Cato.
     - Names of materials,—to denote objects made of the material, or different kinds of the substance; as, aera, bronzes (i.e. bronze figures); ligna, woods.
     - Abstract nouns,—to denote instances of the quality; as, ignōrantiae, cases of ignorance.

## Nouns used in the Plural only

1. Many geographical names; as, Thēbae, Thebes; Leuctra, Leuctra; Pompejī, Pompeii.

2. Many names of festivals; as, Megalēsia, the Megalesian festival.

3. Many special words, of which the following are the most important:

   | Latin     | English             |
   | --------- | ------------------- |
   | angustiae | narrow pass         |
   | arma      | weapons             |
   | dēliciae  | delight             |
   | dīvitiae  | riches              |
   | Īdūs      | Ides                |
   | indūtiae  | truce               |
   | īnsidiae  | ambush              |
   | majōrēs   | ancestors           |
   | mānēs     | spirits of the dead |
   | moenia    | city walls          |
   | minae     | threats             |
   | nūptiae   | marriage            |
   | posterī   | descendants         |
   | reliquiae | remainder           |
   | tenebrae  | darkness            |
   | verbera   | blows               |

   Also in classical prose regularly

   | Latin    | English |
   | -------- | ------- |
   | cervīcēs | neck    |
   | fidēs    | lyre    |
   | nārēs    | nose    |
   | vīscerā  | viscera |

## Nouns used only in Certain Cases

1. Used in only One Case. Many nouns of the Fourth Declension are found only in the Ablative Singular as, jussū, by the order; injussū, without the order; nātū, by birth.

2. Used in Two Cases.

   - Fors (chance), Nom. Sing.; forte, Abl. Sing.
   - Spontis (free-will), Gen. Sing.; sponte, Abl. Sing.

3. Used in Three Cases. Nēmō, no one (Nom.), has also the Dat. nēminī and the Acc. nēminem. The Gen. and Abl. are supplied by the corresponding cases of nūllus; viz. nūllīus and nūllō.
4. Impetus has the Nom., Acc., and Abl. Sing., and the Nom. and Acc. Plu.; viz. impetus, impetum, impetū, impetūs.
5. Opis, dapis, and frūgis,—all lack the Nom. Sing.
6. Many monosyllables of the Third Declension lack the Gen. Plu.: as, cor, lūx, sōl, aes, ōs (ōris), rūs, sāl, tūs.

## Indeclinable Nouns

| Latin  | Gender | English  |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| fās    | n      | right    |
| īnstar | n      | likeness |
| māne   | n      | morning  |
| nefās  | n      | impiety  |
| nihil  | n      | nothing  |
| secus  | n      | sex      |

1. With the exception of māne (which may serve also as Ablative, in the morning), the nouns in this list are simply Neuters confined in use to the Nominative and Accusative Singular.

## Heteroclites

These are nouns whose forms are partly of one declension, and partly of another.

1. Several nouns have the entire Singular of one declension, while the Plural is of another; as,—

   - vās, vāsis (vessel); Plu., vāsa, vāsorōum, vāsīs, etc.
   - jūgerum, jūgerī (acre); Plu., jūgera, jūgerum, jūgeribus, etc.

2. Several nouns, while belonging in the main to one declension, have certain special forms belonging to another. Thus:
   - Many nouns of the First Declension ending in -ia take also a Nom. and Acc. of the Fifth; as, māteriēs, māteriem, material, as well as māteria, māteriam.
   - Famēs, hunger, regularly of the Third Declension, has the Abl. famē of the Fifth.
   - Requiēs, requiētis, rest, regularly of the Third Declension, takes an Acc. of the Fifth, requiem, in addition to requiētem.
   - Besides plēbs, plēbis, common people, of the Third Declension, we find plēbēs, plēbĕī, of the Fifth.

## Heterogeneous Nouns.

Heterogeneous nouns vary in Gender.

1. Several nouns of the Second Declension have two forms,—one Masc. in -us, and one Neuter in -um; as, clipeus, clipeum, shield; carrus, carrum, cart.

2. Other nouns have one gender in the Singular, another in the Plural;

   | Singular          | Plural                       |
   | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
   | balneum, n, bath  | balneae, f, bath-house       |
   | epulum, n, feast  | epulae, f, feast             |
   | frēnum, n, bridle | frēnī, m, bridle             |
   | jocus, m, jest    | joca, n, jests               |
   | locus, m, place   | loca, n, places              |
   | rāstrum, n, rake  | rāstrī, m / rāstra, n, rakes |

   - Heterogeneous nouns may at the same time be heteroclites, as in the case of the first two examples above.

## Plurals with Change of Meaning

The following nouns have one meaning in the Singular and another in the Plural:

| Singular                          | Plural                              |

| carcer, prison                    | carcerēs, stalls for racing-chariot |
| castrum, fort                     | castra, camp                        |

| fīnis, end                        | fīnēs, borders, territory           |
| fortūna, fortune                  | fortūnae, possessions, wealth       |
| grātia, favor, gratitude          | grātiae, thanks                     |
| impedīmentum, hindrance           | impedīmenta, baggage                |

| (ops) opis, help                  | opēs, resources                     |
| pars, part                        | partēs, party; rôle                 |
| sāl, salt                         | sălēs, wit                          |
