# Cases

## Introduction

Latin has six cases that serve different grammatical functions. Understanding these cases is crucial for determining the role of nouns and pronouns within a sentence.

1. Nominative (Case of Subject): This case identifies the subject of a sentence. It is used when the noun or pronoun is the doer of the action. For example, "puella" (girl) in "Puella ambulat" (The girl is walking).

2. Genitive (Objective with "of" or Possessive): The genitive case indicates possession or relationship. It is often translated as "of" in English. For example, "liber patris" (father's book) or "amor puellae" (love of the girl).

3. Dative (Objective with "to" or "for"): The dative case indicates the indirect object of a verb, often translated as "to" or "for" in English. For example, "donum amicō" (gift for the friend) or "puellae rosam dedit" (He gave a rose to the girl).

4. Accusative (Case of Direct Object): The accusative case identifies the direct object of a verb. It answers the question "whom?" or "what?" For example, "legō librum" (I read the book) or "amīcus videt puellam" (The friend sees the girl).

5. Vocative (Case of Address): The vocative case is used for direct address or when calling out to someone. It expresses the person being spoken to. For example, "O puella!" (Oh girl!) or "Amīce!" (Friend!).

6. Ablative (Objective with "by," "from," "in," "with"): The ablative case has various functions, including expressing the means or manner by which something is done, separation, location, and accompaniment. It is translated differently depending on the context. For example, "via ambulat" (He walks by way of the road) or "cum amicīs" (with friends).

## Additional Information

1. Locative: A vestige of the Locative case, which denotes "place where," can be found in names of towns and a few other words.

2. Oblique Cases: The Genitive, Dative, Accusative, and Ablative are collectively referred to as the Oblique Cases.

3. Stem and Case-Endings: Each case is formed by adding specific case-endings to the stem, which is the fundamental part of a noun or pronoun. For example, "portam" (Accusative Singular) is formed by adding the case-ending "-m" to the stem "porta-." In most cases, the final vowel of the stem merges with the case-ending, resulting in an obscured ending. This apparent case-ending is called a termination.
