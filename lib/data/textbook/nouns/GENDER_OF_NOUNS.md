# Gender of Nouns

## Introduction

In Latin, nouns can be categorized into three genders: Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter. The concept of gender in Latin can be either natural or grammatical.

## Natural Gender

Natural gender is determined by the sex of the noun. It is applicable only to names of persons.

1. Masculine: Nouns denoting males fall under this category. Examples include _nauta_ (sailor) and _agricola_ (farmer).

2. Feminine: Nouns denoting females belong to this category. Examples include _māter_ (mother) and _rēgīna_ (queen).

## Grammatical Gender

Grammatical gender, unlike natural gender, is not based on sex but on the general meaning of the word or the ending of its Nominative Singular form. Nouns denoting things or qualities can be classified as Masculine or Feminine based on their signification or the ending of their Nominative Singular form. The following principles guide the determination of grammatical gender:

### A. Gender determined by Signification

1. Masculine: Names of Rivers, Winds, and Months are considered masculine. Examples include _Sēquana_ (Seine), _Eurus_ (east wind), and _Aprīlis_ (April).

2. Feminine: Trees and names of Towns and Islands ending in -_us_ are feminine. For example, _quercus_ (oak), _Corinthus_ (Corinth), and _Rhodus_ (Rhodes). Other names of towns and islands follow the gender of their endings. Examples include _Delphī_, _Leuctra_, _Tībur_, and _Carthāgō_.

3. Neuter: Indeclinable nouns, infinitives, and phrases are considered neuter. Examples include _nihil_ (nothing), _nefās_ (wrong), and _amāre_ (to love).

_Note_: Exceptions to the above principles may occur, such as _Allia_ (the river), which is feminine.

### B. Gender determined by Ending of Nominative Singular

The gender of other nouns is determined by the ending of their Nominative Singular form.

_Note 1_: Some nouns have common gender, meaning they can be either masculine or feminine depending on the context. Examples include _sacerdōs_ (priest/priestess), _cīvis_ (citizen), and _parēns_ (parent).

_Note 2_: Names of animals usually have grammatical gender based on the ending of their Nominative Singular form. However, a single form can designate either the male or female of the species. Examples include _ānser_ (goose/gander), _vulpēs_ (fox), and _aquīla_ (eagle).
