# The Five Declensions

## Introduction

Latin nouns are classified into five declensions, which are distinguished by the final letter of the stem and the termination of the genitive singular. Understanding the declensions is essential for correctly inflecting nouns.

## Cases with Similar Forms

1. Vocative: The vocative case is usually the same as the nominative case, except for singular nouns ending in "-us" in the second declension.

2. Dative and Ablative Plural: The dative and ablative plural cases always have the same form.

3. Neuters: In neuter nouns, the accusative and nominative cases are always the same, and in the plural, they end in "-ă".

4. Third, Fourth, and Fifth Declensions: In the third, fourth, and fifth declensions, the accusative plural is regularly the same as the nominative case.
